1. Switching between portraits
==============================

With the mouse pointer above your player portrait--use the Scroll Wheel
to cycle through all the portraits--including the normal portrait.


2. Editing portrait images
==========================

Images must be saved in the 32-bit TGA format.  The default images have a black
circle which your new portrait should replace.  The area surrounding the circle must be
transparent--otherwise the portrait will get a square shape.

Images must be 64 by 64 pixels.


Open the default images in a suitable image editor--replace the black circle with
whatever you want to have as your portrait.  Save the image.  Use the command /reload in
the game to load the updated images.  Just make sure that they are saved in the same format
and that the area surrounding the circle region remains transparent--otherwise you'll end up
seeing  a square portrait image.


The default images are located in the folder \CustomPlayerPortrait\Portraits:
* 1.tga
* 2.tga
* 3.tga
* 4.tga
* 5.tga


3. Adding more portraits
========================

The AddOn will handle up to 5 images by default.  To increase or
decrease this number--open the Lua file and edit the number by the
variable called highestPortraitIndex.

File:
\CustomPlayerPortrait\Main.lua

Choose to open the file in a plain text editor such as Notepad (Windows).

Variable:
highestPortraitIndex = 5

* Make sure this number corresponds to the number of images in the \Portraits folder.
* Make sure there are no gaps in the numbering of the image files.

Important: You have to close the game after adding more files.


4. Troubleshooting
==================

4.1 Seeing green portrait image
-------------------------------

Possible reasons:
* The image file was not found--possibly due to a gap in the numbering--or if the
highestPortraitIndex doesn't match the number of images in the \Portraits folder.
* The image was saved in a different format that was not supported.

Review the image requirements:
* Images must be 64 by 64 pixels
* Images must be stored in the 32-bit TGA format (RGBA)

4.2 Seeing square portrait image
--------------------------------

Transparency data was not saved--or not applied to the image when it was saved.

Either use the example images--which have a black circle at the
center--and fill the black region with your image.  The image editing
software must handle transparency.

Review the image requirements:
* Images must be stored in the 32-bit TGA format (RGBA)
